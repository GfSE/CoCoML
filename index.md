# CoCoML

A concise and consistent language for modeling (mechatronic) systems and software. UML/SysML offers a plethora of possibilities and as such cannot be mapped to other technical realms like DSL or OWL/RDF. CoCoML defines a practical and formally well defined subset of UML/SysML for bidirectional and lossless mapping with OWL/RDF. We invite you to discuss and improve the choices made!
