# CoCoML - The Purpose

A concise and consistent language for modeling (mechatronic) systems and software. 

UML/SysML offers a plethora of possibilities and cannot be mapped genuinely to any other technical realm. 
CoCoML shall define a practical and formally well defined subset of UML/SysML for bidirectional and lossless mapping with OWL/RDF and perhaps other formats (to be discussed). 
Other notations and languages such as FMC, BPMN and ArchiMate shall be added in future.

# CoCoML - The Way Forward

## Using an Agreed Vocabulary

Among the concepts offered by UML/SysML we will select those deemed relevant for overarching system modeling.
Different modeling languages use their own terminology - but share many concepts. 
The final goal is to put system information from difference sources into a common context.  
A common terminology is essential in all those cases.


## Using FMC for Abstraction

Prof. Dr.-Ing. Siegfried Wendt, founding director of the Hasso-Plattner-Institute in Potsdam, and his collaborators have shown 
that it possible to successfully describe system structure and behavior using three fundamental model elements, namely _Actor_, _State_ and _Event_. 
The concept is extremely promising for integrating models of different notations and tools: Numerous practical examples in more than a decade have shown the power of the approach. 
Therefore we propose the <a href="http://fmc-modeling.org/" target="_blank">Fundamental Modeling Concepts (FMC)</a> as an abstracting layer for system model integration.

## Using SpecIF as Intermediate Format

The Specification Integration Facility ([SpecIF](https://specif.de)) is an information model to build a Knowledge Graph (aka Property Graph) with typed nodes, edges and properties.
[Schema and constraints](https://github.com/GfSE/SpecIF-Schema) are available to assure data quality.
In an intermediate step, model data of different notation and tools is translated to SpecIF. From there, any data format for knowledge graphs can (and will) be created.

## Joint Effort

Worldwide, there are many similar initiatives going on at moment. We do not want to re-invent the wheel: Do you know any other promising approach?

Let us join forces:
- <a href="https://github.com/GfSE/CoCoML/discussions" target="_blank">Discussions</a>
- <a href="https://github.com/GfSE/CoCoML/issues" target="_blank">Issues</a>

Just now, in July 2024, we are at the very beginning. But we are sure that with your help and a joint effort we will succeed.
