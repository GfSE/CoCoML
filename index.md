# CoCoML - The Purpose

A concise and consistent language for modeling (mechatronic) systems and software. 

UML/SysML offers a plethora of possibilities and cannot be mapped genuinely to any other technical realm. 
CoCoML shall define a practical and formally well defined subset of UML/SysML for bidirectional and lossless mapping with OWL/RDF and perhaps other formats (to be discussed).

# CoCoML - The Way Forward

## Using FMC

Prof. Dr.-Ing. Siegfried Wendt, founding director of the Hasso-Plattner-Institute in Potsdam, and his collaborators have shown that it possible to successfully describe system structure and behavior using three fundamental model elements, namely _Actor_, _State_ and _Event_. Unfortunately the impact on the systems engineering community has been limited. However, the concept is extremely promising for integrating models of different notations and tools: Numerous practical examples in more than a decade have shown the power of the approach. Therefore we propose the Fundamental Modeling Concepts (FMC) as an abstracting layer for system model integration.

## Using SpecIF

In an intermediate step, the data is translated to [SpecIF](https://specif.de). From there, any data format for knowledge graphs can (and will) be created.
