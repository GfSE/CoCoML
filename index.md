# CoCoML - The Purpose

A concise and consistent language for modeling (mechatronic) systems and software. 

UML/SysML offers a plethora of possibilities and cannot be mapped genuinely to any other technical realm. 
CoCoML shall define a practical and formally well defined subset of UML/SysML for bidirectional and lossless mapping with OWL/RDF and perhaps other formats (to be discussed). 

# CoCoML - The Way Forward

In an intermediate step, the data is translated to [SpecIF](https://specif.de). From there, any data format for knowledge graphs can (and will) be created.

We invite you to discuss and improve the choices made:
- [Discussions](https://github.com/GfSE/CoCoML/discussions)
- [Issues](https://github.com/GfSE/CoCoML/issues)

Just now, in July 2024, we are at the very beginning. But we are sure that with your help and a joint effort we will succeed.
