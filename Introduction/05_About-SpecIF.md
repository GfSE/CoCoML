# About SpecIF

The Specification Integration Facility (SpecIF) integrates partial system models from different methods and tools in a semantic net. 
Collaborators shall browse, search and audit engineering results in a common context. 
Also, the exchange of model information between organizations and tools is facilitated. 
SpecIF represents the visible, i.e. the diagrams and the text, as well as the semantics of system specifications. UTF-8 encoding is preferred.
