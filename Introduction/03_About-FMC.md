# About FMC

The Fundamental Modeling Concepts (FMC) are a modeling technique created especially to support the communication about information processing systems. 
FMC uses a simple notation which can be used easily for ad-hoc creation of models in meetings. 
FMC is not tied to any programming paradigm and can even be used for information processing systems which are implemented with a hardware / software mix.[^2]

FMC has been created and refined by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/siegfried-wendt-2331445a/" target="_blank">Siegfried Wendt</a> and his group in many industrial projects. 
FMC is based on established concepts such as Petri nets and Entity/Relationship modeling, and has been consequently tailored to support communication.[^2]

Later on, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/odungern/" target="_blank">Oskar von Dungern</a> and his colleagues have applied FMC 
also to mechatronic systems including production sites and logistic chains.
