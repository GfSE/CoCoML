# CoCoML

A concise and consistent language for modeling (mechatronic) systems and software. 

UML/SysML offers a plethora of possibilities and cannot be mapped genuinely to other technical realms like DSL or OWL/RDF. 
CoCoML shall define a practical and formally well defined subset of UML/SysML for bidirectional and lossless mapping with OWL/RDF. 
In an intermediate step, the data is translated to [SpecIF](https://specif.de). From there, any data format for knowledge graphs can (and will) be created.

We invite you to discuss and improve the choices made:
- [Discussions](https://github.com/GfSE/CoCoML/discussions)
- [Issues](https://github.com/GfSE/CoCoML/issues)
